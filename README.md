Using a BadUSB/USB Ducky Script, make a chromebook pretty much unusable. Uses acceciblity settings to alter the chromebooks. Disables Trackpad, enables magnifier, flips colors, Enables chromevox and spams tabs. Whole script can be executed in under 20 seconds if window and tab spamming is skipped. Because the Trackpad is off, the person cannot do anything, and because magnifer is on they cannot see how to turn tackpad back on, or use touch. Chromevox makes it much more annoying to turn everything off. *USE ONLY ON YOUR CHROMEBOOK*
Just Plug in Flipper Zero or any other BADUSB device and press start and thats all.
