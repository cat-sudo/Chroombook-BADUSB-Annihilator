Using a BadUSB/USB Ducky Script, make a chromebook pretty much unusable. Disables Trackpad, enables magnifier, flips colors, Enables chromevox and spams tabs. Whole script can be executed in under 20 seconds if window and tab spamming is skipped. *USE ONLY ON YOUR CHROMEBOOK*
Just Plug in Flipper Zero or any other BADUSB device and press start and thats all.
